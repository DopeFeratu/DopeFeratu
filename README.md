- 👋 Hi, I’m @DopeFeratu
- 👀 I’m interested in damn near everything; time off during this pandemic has really opened my eyes and taught me a lot!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I'm still constantly changing and very adaptable, and maybe just fully coming into the person I  know I wanted to be
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tangible hands-on projects, as well as more thought-provoking abstract applications. I have a positive attitude and truly believe that I can, in conjunction with the right people concur anything!
- 📫 How to reach me ... CountDopeula@protonmail.com
